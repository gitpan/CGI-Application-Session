NAME
    CGI::Application::Session - Add CGI::Session support to CGI::Application

SYNOPSIS
     use CGI::Application::Session;

     my $language = $self->session->param('language');

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Application::Session seamlessly adds session support to your
    CGI::Application modules by providing a CGI::Session object that is
    accessible from anywhere in the application.

    Lazy loading is used to prevent expensive file system or database calls
    from being made if the session is not needed during this request. In
    other words, the Session object is not created until it is actually
    needed. Also, the Session object will act as a singleton by always
    returning the same Session object for the duration of the request.

    This module aims to be as simple and non obtrusive as possible. By not
    requiring any changes to the inheritance tree of your modules, it can be
    easily added to existing applications. Think of it as a plugin module
    that adds a couple of new methods directly into the CGI::Application
    namespace simply by loading the module.

METHODS
  session
    This method will return the current CGI::Session object. The
    CGI::Session object is created on the first call to this method, and any
    subsequent calls will return the same object. This effectively creates a
    singleton session object for the duration of the request. CGI::Session
    will look for a cookie or param containing the session ID, and create a
    new session if none is found. If "session_config" has not been called
    before the first call to "session", then it will choose some sane
    defaults to create the session object.

      # retrieve the session object
      my $session = $self->session;
 
      - or -
 
      # use the session object directly
      my $language = $self->session->param('language');

  session_config
    This method can be used to customize the functionality of the
    CGI::Application::Session module. Calling this method does not mean that
    a new session object will be immediately created. The session object
    will not be created until the first call to $self->session. This 'lazy
    loading' can prevent expensive file system or database calls from being
    made if the session is not needed during this request.

    The recommended place to call "session_config" is in the "cgiapp_init"
    stage of CGI::Application. If this method is called after the session
    object has already been accessed, then it will die with an error
    message.

    If this method is not called at all then a reasonable set of defaults
    will be used (the exact default values are defined below).

    The following parameters are accepted:

    CGI_SESSION_OPTIONS
        This allows you to customize how the CGI::Session object is created
        by providing a list of options that will be passed to the
        CGI::Session constructor. Please see the documentation for
        CGI::Session for the exact syntax of the parameters.

    COOKIE_PARAMS
        This allows you to customize the options that are used when creating
        the session cookie. For example you could provide an expiry time for
        the cookie by passing -expiry => '+24h'. The -name and -value
        parameters for the cookie will be added automatically unless you
        specifically override them by providing -name and/or -value
        parameters. See the CGI::Cookie docs for the exact syntax of the
        parameters.

    SEND_COOKIE
        If set to a true value, the module will automatically add a cookie
        header to the outgoing headers. This option defaults to true. If it
        is set to false, then no session cookies will be sent, which may be
        useful if you prefer URL based sessions (it is up to you to pass the
        session ID in this case).

    The following example shows what options are set by default (ie this is
    what you would get if you do not call session_config).

     $self->session_config(
              CGI_SESSION_OPTIONS => [ "driver:File", $self->query, {Directory=>'/tmp'} ],
              COOKIE_PARAMS       => {
                                       -path  => '/',
                                     },
              SEND_COOKIE         => 1,
     );

    Here is a more customized example that uses the PostgreSQL driver and
    sets an expiry and domain on the cookie.

     $self->session_config(
              CGI_SESSION_OPTIONS => [ "driver:PostgreSQL;serializer:Storable", $self->query, {Handle=>$dbh} ],
              COOKIE_PARAMS       => {
                                       -domain  => 'mydomain.com',
                                       -expires => '+24h',
                                       -path    => '/',
                                       -secure  => 1,
                                     },
     );
 
  session_cookie
    This method will add a cookie to the outgoing headers containing the
    session ID that was assigned by the CGI::Session module. This method is
    called automatically the first time $self->session is accessed (unless
    SEND_COOKIE was set to false), so it will most likely never need to be
    called manually. It could be useful if you want to force the cookie
    header to be sent out even if the session is not used on this request,
    or if you want to manage the headers yourself by turning SEND_COOKIE to
    false.

      # Force the cookie header to be sent including some
      # custom cookie parameters
      $self->session_cookie(-secure => 1, -expires => '+1w');

EXAMPLE
    In a CGI::Application module:

      # configure the session once during the init stage
      sub cgiapp_init {
        my $self = shift;
 
        # Configure the session
        $self->session_config(
           CGI_SESSION_OPTIONS => [ "driver:PostgreSQL;serializer:Storable", $self->query, {Handle=>$self->dbh} ],
           COOKIE_PARAMS       => {
                                    -expires => '+24h',
                                    -path    => '/',
                                  },
           SEND_COOKIE         => 1,
        );
 
      }
 
      sub cgiapp_prerun {
        my $self = shift;
 
        # Redirect to login, if necessary
        unless ( $self->session->param('~logged-in') ) {
          $self->prerun_mode('login');
        }
      }
 
      sub my_runmode {
        my $self = shift;
 
        # Load the template
        my $template = $self->load_tmpl('my_runmode.tmpl');
 
        # Add all the session parameters to the template
        $template->param($self->session->param_hashref());
 
        # return the template output
        return $template->output;
      }

BUGS
    This is alpha software and as such, the features and interface are
    subject to change. So please check the Changes file when upgrading. If
    you want to use CGI::Application::Session in a production environment,
    please wait for version 1.0.

TODO
    *   I am considering adding support for other session modules in the
        future, like Apache::Session and possibly others if there is a
        demand.

    *   Possibly add some tests to make sure cookies are accepted by the
        client.
