Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application::Session.

0.07  Sat Jun 11 13:24:38 EDT 2005

    - This module has been renamed to CGI::Application::Plugin::Session,
      and hence CGI::Application::Session has been depricated.  This
      will be the last official version of this module (barring any
      serious bugs).  CGI::Application::Plugin::Session version 0.07 is
      identical in everything but name to this module, so it is a drop
      in replacement.


    - New config option DEFAULT_EXPIRY which will automatically call
      the CGI::Session 'expire' method for all newly created sessions
    - The cookie now sets the Expires header based on the expiry
      time of the CGI::Session object (patch by Mark Stosberg)
    - Changed the hash key where we store all the private info in
      the CGI::Application object to be a bit more unique to this
      plugin module
    - expanded the coverage of the test suite
  Bugs:
    - If you didn't import the session_cookie method into your
      namespace, calls to $self->session would fail.
    - If you called session_cookie manually, it was possible under
      specific conditions that the session wasn't created yet,
      and the cookie would not be created properly

    - CGI::Session will currently only work with CGI.pm so check to see
      if CGI::Application is configured to use another CGI.pm like
      module like CGI::Simple
    - Be more intelligent about choosing a default temporary directory
      for windows users (suggested by Dan Horne)
    - Add a doc note to warn users when they change the name of the
      cookie, to also notify CGI::Session->name

0.05  Sun Sep 19 18:13:03 EST 2004

    - scrap CGI::Application::Plugin support for simple Exporter
      system.
    - Moved module to the CGI::Application::Plugin namespace

0.04  Mon Jul 26 23:44:39 EST 2004

    - add support for the new CGI::Application::Plugin base class

0.03  Tue Feb 10 22:12:29 EST 2004

  - fool Module::Build into ignoring the 'package CGI::Application'
    directive in CGI::Application::Session so that it doesn't list
    CGI::Application as being provided by the distribution in the
    META.yml file. (there must be a better way!)

  - updated the Build.PL script

  - Fixed a silly documentation error


0.02  Tue Feb 10 14:59:51 EST 2004

  - WARNING: changed the way in which session_config accepts
    parameters.  Please check the docs because this will
    affect anyone that was using the session_config method
    in version 0.01.  It is more flexible now, and will allow
    for future additions.

  - altered doc example by moving authentication check
    to cgiapp_prerun to co-inside with the examples in the
    CGI::Application docs - "Clayton L. Scott" <tex@engsoc.org>

  - automatically add a cookie to the outgoing headers if there
    isn't one there already (requires CGI::Application 3.21)

  - changed the code to conform to some of the CGI::Application
    coding standards
