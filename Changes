Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application::Session.

0.03  Tue Feb 10 22:12:29 EST 2004

  - fool Module::Build into ignoring the 'package CGI::Application'
    directive in CGI::Application::Session so that it doesn't list
    CGI::Application as being provided by the distribution in the
    META.yml file. (there must be a better way!)

  - updated the Build.PL script

  - Fixed a silly documentation error


0.02  Tue Feb 10 14:59:51 EST 2004

  - WARNING: changed the way in which session_config accepts
    parameters.  Please check the docs because this will
    affect anyone that was using the session_config method
    in version 0.01.  It is more flexible now, and will allow
    for future additions.

  - altered doc example by moving authentication check
    to cgiapp_prerun to co-inside with the examples in the
    CGI::Application docs - "Clayton L. Scott" <tex@engsoc.org>

  - automatically add a cookie to the outgoing headers if there
    isn't one there already (requires CGI::Application 3.21)

  - changed the code to conform to some of the CGI::Application
    coding standards
